id:SquarePaymentForm
title:SquarePaymentForm
---
Creates a Square Payment Form and renders form inputs to use inside of it.

This component requires 3 arguments for basic use:
* **applicationId**: This can be found in your [Square Developer Dashboard](https://developer.squareup.com/apps)
for the current Square app you're developing
* **locationId**: You can retrieve this from the [Square Connect v2 Locations API](https://docs.connect.squareup.com/api/connect/v2#navsection-locations);
or your [Square Developer Dashboard](https://developer.squareup.com/apps).
It determines which Square location will receive credit for payments made with this form.
* **cardNonceResponseReceived**: This callback gives you a nonce to pass to your back-end server to make a "charge" request to Square.
* **createVerificationDetails**: This callback returns data used for [Strong Customer Authentication](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/sca-overview)

...and one additional argument for digital wallets:
* **createPaymentRequest**: This callback returns data to show information about the payment in the Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Masterpass interfaces.

Please view the [Payment Form Data Models](https://docs.connect.squareup.com/api/paymentform) for additional information.
